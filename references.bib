  abstract = "Complete case analysis is widely used for handling missing data,
              and it is the default method in many statistical packages.
              However, this method may introduce bias and some useful
              information will be omitted from analysis. Therefore, many
              imputation methods are developed to make gap end. The present
              article focuses on single imputation. Imputations with mean,
              median and mode are simple but, like complete case analysis, can
              introduce bias on mean and deviation. Furthermore, they ignore
              relationship with other variables. Regression imputation can
              preserve relationship between missing values and other variables.
              There are many sophisticated methods exist to handle missing
              values in longitudinal data. This article focuses primarily on
              how to implement R code to perform single imputation, while
              avoiding complex mathematical calculations.",
